**Screening question:**
“Do you own more than 10Gbs of photos/videos which you struggle to store and have easily accessible?” 

**Description**
Andrew is an amateur photographer who is passionate about capturing the beauty of the moment. He owns a large collection of images which he stores on Google Drive. He owns an upgraded subscription to Google Drive since his 5+ years old picture collections are way bigger than 10Gbs.  He frequently browses his collection of images and loves to share it with his friends. One day Taric dreams of owning a website where he would be able to sell his photos.

**Problem**
Andrew uses Google Cloud for storing, accessing and sharing his numerous pictures. Over the course of 3 years the costs for Google Cloud solutions have piled up.

**Alternatives**
Andrew can use devices such as USBs/SSDs/Hard Disks which can be lost/damaged. Andrew finds these devices to be a hustle as they are easily lost/damaged, are hard to organize and have to be physically carried wherever he goes.
Alternatively he could use another 3rd party solution similar to Google cloud but core issues regarding cost and someone else owning the data persist.

**Value proposition**
With project Jorgan Andrew can easily store, manipulate and share his images while also having the privilege of handling his own data. Furthermore his dream of running a website can finally become a reality. Although the initial cost will be high, it still beats Google's solution in a period of 2 to 3 years.
