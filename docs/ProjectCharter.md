## Client
Project Jorgan is developed for personal use; henceforth the main clients are the developers.

## Problem definiton and end goal

In the informational day and age of today, a single person is expected to have gigabytes of personal data such as images, documents, movies, projects, music etc… Furthermore, efficient management in the form of easy remote access and manipulation of those resources is vital. 

Most people outsource the cumbersome job of storing and managing their data to bigger companies, such as Google with their Google Cloud solution. These companies offer almost magical access to data from anywhere as well as its manipulation. This comes with the cost of your data being at someone else’s “mercy”. Free options of Google Cloud are also highly limited allowing for only 10Gb of space, while anything above that implies monthly payments.

The goal of project Jorgan is to develop a personal server solution with help of existing open source technologies. Server should be able to cover some basic cloud functionalities such as storing/viewing immages and files from anywhere. Somewhat unlike Google cloud, extended goal of project Jorgan is to allow for hosting of up to 3 websites (with low low trafic) and a database.


## Resources
### Financial
Financial resources are limited to 700€. <br>
Financial goal of this project is to maximize set up cost and minimize reocuring costs. Ideally only reocuring cost should be electricity and DNS services costs.
