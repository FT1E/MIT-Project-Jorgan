## Client
Project Jorgen is developed for personal use; henceforth the main clients are the developers.

## Problem definiton and end goal
<!-- change 'end goal' if you want
    don't know what to write there instead
 -->

In the informational day and age of today, a single person is expected to have gigabytes of personal data such as images, documents, movies, projects, music etc…Furthermore, efficient management in the form of easy remote access and manipulation of those resources is vital. 

Most people outsource this cumbersome job of storing and managing their data to bigger companies, such as Google Cloud. These companies offer almost magical access to data from anywhere as well as its manipulation. However this comes with the cost of your data being at someone else’s “mercy”. 

The goal of project Jorgan is to develop a server that can cover chosen functionalities of Google Cloud infrastructure, assess and compare its cost all while keeping the data at the hands of users. 

## Resources
### Financial
Financial resources amount to 10,000 $. <br>
70% of those will be used for maintenance and additional improvement on the server hardware. The rest will be used as a salary for the dev team, on a monthly basis for 6 months.

### Personel / Staff
The personel consists of 2 students in their last year of undegraduate studies (Computer Science degree).
