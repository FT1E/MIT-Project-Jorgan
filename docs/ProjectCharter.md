## Client
Project Jorgan is developed for personal use; henceforth the main clients are the developers.

## Problem definiton and end goal

In the informational day and age of today, a single person is expected to have gigabytes of personal data such as images, documents, movies, projects, music etc… Furthermore, efficient management in the form of easy remote access and manipulation of those resources is vital. 

Most people outsource the cumbersome job of storing and managing their data to bigger companies, such as Google with their Google Cloud solution. These companies offer almost magical access to data from anywhere as well as its manipulation. This comes with the cost of your data being at someone else’s “mercy”. Free options of Google Cloud are also highly limited allowing for only 10Gb of space, while anything above that implies monthly payments.

The goal of project Jorgan is to develop a personal server solution with help of existing open source technologies. Server should be able to cover some basic cloud functionalities such as storing/viewing immages and files from anywhere. Somewhat unlike Google cloud, extended goal of project Jorgan is to allow for hosting of up to 3 websites (with low low trafic) and a database.


## Resources
### Financial
Financial resources are limited to 700€. <br>
Financial goal of this project is to maximize set up cost and minimize reocuring costs. Ideally only reocuring cost should be electricity and DNS services costs.

## Objectives and milestone
<!-- todo - we gotta have like specific objectives  -->

1. Select suitable hardware solutions.
2. Select suitable open source software solutions. 
3. Server is operational and can be accessed from LAN.
4. Server is operational and can be accessed from any device from a browser.
5. Server can be manipulated remotely via SSH-like tool.
6. Server can be used for storing and viewing images and has a satisfactory UI designated for it.
7. Server can host up to 3 (low low trafic) websites.
8. Server should have up time greater then 10h per day.
9. Total cost of the project must not exceed 700€.
10. Server maintenance cost is minimized.

<!-- todo - what do we put here? -->
>Note: after developing the textual UI, a month and a half is allocated for testing. Similar for GUI time between development and testing.

## Techniques and Technologies used
- Agile methodology
- Full Stack Web App - using express for back end, and react for front end.
