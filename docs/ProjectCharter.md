## Client
Project Jorgen is developed for personal use; henceforth the main clients are the developers.

## Problem definiton, purpose and objectives

In the informational day and age of today, a single person is expected to have gigabytes of personal data such as images, documents, movies, projects, music etc…Furthermore, efficient management in the form of easy remote access and manipulation of those resources is vital. 

Most people outsource this cumbersome job of storing and managing their data to bigger companies, such as Google Cloud. These companies offer almost magical access to data from anywhere as well as its manipulation. However this comes with the cost of your data being at someone else’s “mercy”. 

The goal of project Jorgan is to develop a server that can cover chosen functionalities of Google Cloud infrastructure, assess and compare its cost all while keeping the data at the hands of users.
