**Name:** Brad, the Clerk

**Age:** 52

**Occupation/Function:** Retired Clerk**

**Tech level:** 4/10

**Screening question:** <br>
“Do you have files that you need private access to, but hate the idea of someone else seeing/having access to them.” 

**Description**<br>
Brad is a senior Clerk, outside of daily job he also manages his families documentation as well as the documentation of his parents and inlaws. Brad needs easy and reliable access to his important and personal documents, henceforth he keeps a pile of paper boxes full of documents.

**Problem**<br>
One afternoon Brad decides to visit his elderly mother; whom starts a conversation regarding her passport application documents. She doesn’t trust Brad submitted them, as he said that he would bring the documents next time he comes over; however, being in a rush he has forgotten them at home.

**Alternatives**<br>
Instead of using paper Brad could use USBs/SSDs/Hard Disks to store his documents (this is the technology he is highly familiar with as he worked as a clerk), however that would require him to remember to bring them with him.
Alternatively he could use Google Storage solutions; which for brad isn’t a real option as he despises Google.


**Value proposition** <br>
Brad Could use a personal server described by the Jorgan project. It will allow him to access his files from anywhere whilst still not having to give them over to the notorious Google. This would allow him to have better organisation. He would never forget to bring his mother documents again and he could finally get rid of the boxes with papers which his wife hates.
