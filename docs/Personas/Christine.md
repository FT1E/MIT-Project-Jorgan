**Tech level:** 9/10

**Screening question:**<br>
"Do you need a server to host web applications or multiplayer online games for personal or business use?"

**Description** <br>
Christine is a computer science student in her last year and is very enthusiastic to build her own personal projects. Lately she has been interested in building apps which connect multiple users, not just pieces of code which are run locally on a single computer. She wants to build a portfolio website which can be accessed by anyone. She also has an interest in moving from making offline games to multiplayer games, which can be played by 2 or more people, which are on different computers. <br>
In both cases she has encountered the issue of needing a server to host.

**Problem** <br>
There are organizations which offer hosting servers for other people to run, but not at a cheap price if considered over a longer period of time. 
Ignoring the cost, another issue is that most of these organizations don't offer much customizations. They limit to what is run on their servers to specific project setups. Like only hosting web apps made with react. Or hosting servers but only for popular games.

**Other Alternative** <br>
A possible alternative would be for Christine to buy hardware and set up her own server. But depending on her knowledge and experience, this could take quite a bit of her time, which could've been spent on building personal projects. Also the number of clients using the services hosted on her server, partly depends on how much she has invested in the server hardware. The electricity bills also have to be considered which can be quite high depending on the server's activity.

**Value proposition** <br>
What Project Jorgan offers Christine is a cheaper alternative. A virtual environment on a server connected to the internet, which she can use to host any service for whatever kind of personal project she is building at the time. Her virtual environment cannot affect or be affected by the virtual environment of any other customer. She will have the freedom to host whatever service she needs for any kind of personal project.
